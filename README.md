# AutoClick

AutoClick is a recreation of the linux based xClicker application using the JavaFX framework. xClicker is a GUI and is very user-friendly. This application is very intutitve and can be used during use of another application. This will allow you to click on other applications.

This autoclicker was developed using multi-threading which will allow for extremely fast clicks without crashing the program. There is a failsafe however for an interval of 500ms between clicks. This is to save both the xClicker program, and your computer.

Use this autoclicker at your own risk as this can be against the terms of service for some videogames. Almost all video games have the terms of service public and for anyone to view.
